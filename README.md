## Key Contributions:
- Implemented an image capturing function to collect anchor and positive images.
- Designed a data pipeline to fetch images from anchor, positive, and negative image directories.
- Trained the model for 8 epochs and saved it in .keras format.

## Performance:
- Validated the model, achieving a recall and precision score of 1 (100%).

## Modularization:

- Refactored the project from a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) into a modular program, enabling seamless integration into a face recognition system.
